# ASCII Art Animator

![Screenshot](screenshot.png)

ASCII Art Animator is a simple web application that allows you to create and animate ASCII art.
It overlays the current frame with the previous and next frames to give you a better idea of the animation.
It starts with a default animation that you can modify and save as JSON.
The animation is not saved automatically, so you have to copy the content of the text area to save it.
By changing the content of the text area, you can load an animation from JSON.

This application is written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and is stored in a single HTML file so you can use it offline.

You can use it online at [ASCII Art Animator](https://derdere.github.io/ascii-art-animator/)
